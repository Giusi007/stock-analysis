# Stock Analysis with VBA
Using VBA to create a macro in Excel that can be used to analyze stock market data. 

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Using the macro created for this project, we can find and record the Total Daily Volume of stock sold for a particular stock symbol ticker, and also the Rreturn of that stock over a year. This can be used to compare the performance of different stock purchases in order to make more informed decisions about stock that you should invest in. Over the course of the project, the code was refactored (cleaned and streamlined) to run as fast as possible so that the macro can be used on larger data sets as well. The macro can be used to analyze stock data from any year, and it can be run by simply clicking a button in your Excel Workbook.

## Results
In this project, the Excel Macro was used to analyze stock data from the years 2017 and 2018.
