# Stock Analysis with VBA
Using VBA to create a macro in Excel that can be used to analyze stock market data. 

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Using the macro created for this project, we can find and record the Total Daily Volume of stock sold for a particular stock symbol ticker, and also the Rreturn of that stock over a year. This can be used to compare the performance of different stock purchases in order to make more informed decisions about stock that you should invest in. Over the course of the project, the code was refactored (cleaned and streamlined) to run as fast as possible so that the macro can be used on larger data sets as well. The macro can be used to analyze stock data from any year, and it can be run by simply clicking a button in your Excel Workbook.

## Results

### Analysis
In this project, the Excel Macro was used to analyze stock data from the years 2017 and 2018. We analyzed 12 different stocks tickers to find the total daily volume traded and the return on investment in each year. The analysis showed that in 2017, WORDS. In 2018, WORDS. The tickers that had consistently postive return in 2017 and 2018 were TICKERS.

### Code Review
As part of this project, we refactored code to run faster and more efficiently so that larger data sets can also be analyzed easily. Refactoring the code had the impact of cutting down the run time for analyzing 2018 stock data from TIME to TIME and analyzing the 2017 stock data from TIME to TIME. The refactored code, with comments, can be seen below.

### Summary
The advantages of refactoring code is that it can make the code run more efficiently, and also be more understandable to yourself or other who are working on it in the future. A disadvantage could be that refactoring code takes additional time, but focusing on efficiency and clarity when you are writing code saves a lot of time and errors in the future if you are using the code over and over again.

For example, in this project, refactoring the VBA script impacted the run time of the script. Although cutting time down by AMOUNT may seem trivial, this would have a greater impact on large data sets. Creating multiple different arrays and variables and coding with them could result in some confusion if someone else is looking at the script or working on it in the future, so it is important to add comments explaining what each section of code is meant to be doing.
